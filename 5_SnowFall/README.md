# Coding Challenge - Snowfall

Video for this challenge on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl-mHFCGzYk)

This Coding Challenge, was to create a snowfall effect on the canvas.

To achieve this we use a spritesheet,where we cut out images of snowflakes.

Then create snow objects when are put onto the canvas.

The objects are effected by forces applied to them to move across the screen as though it is snowing.

I followed this tutorial then i added in the windchime from previous exercise in the forces section.

The wind chime is the direction the snowflakes are falling in along with gravity.
