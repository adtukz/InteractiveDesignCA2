# The Nature of Code - Vectors

Vectors are a quantity having direction as well as magnitude, especially as determining the position of one point in space relative to another. For p5 they are the hyptonouse created from an x and y point.
I.E 3x and 4y gives a hyptonuse of 5. 
3^2 + 4^2 = 5^5
 9  + 16  = 25
